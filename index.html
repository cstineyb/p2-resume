		<h2>Major: VCD</h2>
			<p>I'm pursuing post-baccalaureate studies in Visual Communication Design because making and fixing things is what I love to do. My current areas of interest include Typography, Information Architecture and Environmental Design. I'm particulary interested in Edward Tufte's work on analyzing visual data, and the too often blurred lines between accuracy and artfulness. To me, Visual Communication Design is thought made real. Visual thinking. Pulling magic from the ether. It's also a great opportunity to use aesthetic means to solve a variety of visual/spacial problems, be they print, web, or environmental.

				<h2>Where are you going, where have you been?</h2>

				<p>I spent over two decades working in the food industry. My formal training in culinary arts has blessed me with the ability to multi-task, work well under pressure, and to experiment creatively. A great chef balances stability and adventurousness, restraint and creativity , humility and self-confidence. I see this kind of adaptability as a great attribute in a design professional.</p>

				<p> My work is informed by the breadth of my life experience-- at least 40% of which came before the advent of the publicly accessible internet. In fact, I remember Netscape Navigator. And <em>typewriters</em>.</p> 
				<p>My recent work has included T-shirts, coasters, retail labels and POS materials, as well as some irreverent infographics. The coasters to the left were a project from  the Design History class, Spring Quarter, 2014.</p>
				<p>Inspired by complexity and drawn to minimalism, all I wanna do is stick the landing. I'm new to web development and its many complexities, and I'm happy to learn more. So I practice:</p>

				<h2> But who are you, really?</h2>
				<p>Born in Southern California, a while back, I've lived in every state on the west coast, and the rural Welsh village of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lampeter" target="_blank">Llandbedr Pont Stefan</a>. I moved to Spokane in 2010, and am happy to call it my hometown. My spare time is consumed with cycling, wrenching on bikes, growing and cooking food, fermenting probiotic beverages, fixing things, designing things, building things, and the <a href="http://spoku.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">daily haiku</a> practice I started a couple years ago. It's all kinds of wonderful.</p>
